tasks: 
think about empty set visualisations
think about exceptions 

think about normal UI. variants:
    new window
    tabs (you can find them in internet or reassign tab by yourself)
        reassign tab so that it could close 
        not open tab if it exists, but go to previous version
        switch to opened tab straight after creating 

start data visualization 
I guess, there will be a new module
